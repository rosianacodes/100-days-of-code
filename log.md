# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 7, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I watched a Python tutorial for beginners and coded along with it. 
I also watched 2 lessons of the ‘automate the boring stuff with python’ alongside the book format.

**Thoughts:** I’m really excited to use this knowledge in my daily life #softlife

### Day 2: February 8, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** I continued watching the Python tutorial. I also did a few Python exercises on Exercism, Edabit and HackerRank. I did this to find the platform I enjoy the most and therefore want to commit to. Edabit ended up being the platform that won me over.

**Thoughts:** I'm enjoying the python tutorial, it's very easy to understand. However, I did struggle with some of the exercises on HackerRank. HackerRank really had my brain scrambling. So I'm thinking of revisiting it when I gain a little more confidence with Python and I'll just focus on Edabit because it is more beginner friendly for me.

### Day 3: February 9, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** I've gone through a few lessons in the Automate the Boring Stuff with Python playlist, looked into Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code course and did a few Python exercises on edabit.

**Thoughts:** I'm really digging Angela's Yu's 100 days of code course. I'm considering starting it but after I finish watch the other youtube tutorials in my study plan. I found the python exercises on edabit really easy, which really boosted my confidence.

### Day 4: February 10, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** I learned about while loops, break statement and contiue statements. I also did a few python exercises.

**Thoughts:** I was really tired and found myself falling alseep through the python exercises but I'm proud of myself for sticking to this commitment no matter how tired I am.

### Day 6: February 12, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** Today I worked on some of Day 1 of Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python Course covering printing, inputting, commenting, name error, syntax error, debugging and string manipulation.  

**Thoughts:** Even though I'm already familiar with all the topics covered. I really enjoyed how interactive it was, the debugging exercise was favourite.

### Day 8: February 14, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** I finished off the freecodecamp survey form using HTML, that I started a while ago. I'm glad I finally have that ticked off now

**Thoughts:** I decided to focus on HTML today as I feel like I hadn't touched it in a while and I'm glad I did because it was a great refresher for my mind. I prepared myself to start the 100devs bootcamp as I feel like I'm not confident in my front end skills, I'm starting to feel more confident in my back end skills because I'm spending more time on 'her'. So I think it's time I'm fair and treat back-end and front-end equally. Not sure how I'm going to do this maybe alternate between front end and python every other day or 2 days or weeks. I think I'm edging towards just doing what I feel like on the day.Shout out to my emotional authority.

### Day 9: February 16, 2023 

**Today's Progress:**  Today I worked on some of Day 2 of Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python Course covering data types and type conversions. 

**Thoughts:** I am so tired, kept falling asleep. So I kept my session very short. Hopefully tomorrow I'll have more energy.

### Day 10: February 17, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** Completed Day 2 of Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python Course. For today's project I made a tip calculator.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed creating this project, it's interesting to see how python is used to make our lives easier.

### Day 11: February 18, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** Worked on conditional statements with Day 3 of Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python Course.

**Thoughts:** I'm really falling in love with this course, even though some of the coding challenges take me a while to do. I feel like I'm really understanding the topics because I'm putting everything I learn into practice. I can't wait to see my progress over the next 100 days. I know it's going to be amazing. I really want to start watching the 100devs bootcamp because I don't feel as confident in my front end skills. My back-end skills are deffo taking the lead but I just think that may be becasue I've been spending more time doing it. I'm kinda considering software engineering now becasue I'm actually enjoying it but I want to give front end an equal chance before making up my mind or I can just be a full stack developer.


### Day 12: February 19, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** I solved a python coding exercise on Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python Course and started watching the 100devs introduction video.


### Day 13: February 20, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** I learned about materialize, bootstrap and completed the HTML and CSS for my films database python project.

**Thoughts:** All this time I thought bootstrap was a complex framework but it seems way easier than I initially thought. It actually makes life easier.


### Day 14: February 21, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** I created a nav bar for my portfolio with the help of a 'Learn MaterializeCSS and create a new portfolio' playlist (part 1 and 2 videos).

**Thoughts:** I got stuck on how to get the hamburger icon to show up in the nav bar for mobile devices or when the page size is shrunk horizontally. It is showing 'menu' when page size decreases instead of the hamburger icon. The 'menu' link is also showing the slide-out page of navigation links as it is supposed to.

### Day 15: February 22, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** I created a nav bar for my portfolio website with the help of a 'Learn MaterializeCSS and create a new portfolio' playlist. 

**Thoughts:** I'm so happy I fixed the hamburger icon issue from yesterday with the help of my instructor Tim. The issue was material-icons link needed tp be added in the head (<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">) and jQuery script needed to be added at the bottom of the body tag but above the CDN Js Script and my Js Script(<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.3.min.js" integrity="sha256-pvPw+upLPUjgMXY0G+8O0xUf+/Im1MZjXxxgOcBQBXU=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>)

### Day 18: February 25, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** I worked on building my portfolio  website using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

**Thoughts:** This portfolio project has really consumed my time for the last past days, can't wait to finish it.

### Day 19: February 26, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** I worked on building a portfolio website using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 



### Day 20: February 27, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** I completed my portfolio website using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

**Thoughts:** This took me the whole day (about 10 hours), it was challenging especially at the end when I didn't know how to host the website on one.com and with the time constraint on me, I decided to get a link from github pages but then the css wasn't loading on the webpage so that took quite abit of trial and error to fix. I believe the issue was either moving the css down at the bottom of the head tag instead of being at the top or it was add the type of css file in the code (type="text/css). It feels so good to be done with this project!

### Day 21: March 1, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** Decided to continue watching class 1 of #100devs.

**Thoughts:** I was really tired so I just decided to do something light today.

### Day 22: March 8, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** Continued watching class 1 of #100devs.

**Thoughts:** I have taken a whole week off from 100daysofcode but I really feel like I need the break. I'm feeling better now I'm looking forward to moving forward with my journey. I learnt about how to learn with active recall and spaced repitition. I also learned about the importance of networking.


### Day 23: March 12, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** Watched class 1 of #100devs.


### Day 24: March 13, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** Finished watching class 1 of #100devs, made anki flashcards on class 1 notes.

**Thoughts:** I learned how to learn and how to take notes effectively, I plan on using anki flashcards daily as spaced repetition and active recall are the most effective study methods. I also learned about VPN, ISP, Server and Client.


### Day 25: March 23, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Day 3 on Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python Course working on else, if and elif statements.

**Thoughts:** I can't believe it's been 10 days since I made my last log, I'm feeling refreshed after my break and I'm ready to commit 1 hour every day no matter how tired I am. I will fall asleep coding if that's what it takes. It was really refreshing going over else, if and elif statements.
