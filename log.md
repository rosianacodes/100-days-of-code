# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 7, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I watched a Python tutorial for beginners and coded along with it. 
I also watched 2 lessons of the ‘automate the boring stuff with python’ alongside the book format.

**Thoughts:** I’m really excited to use this knowledge in my daily life #softlife

### Day 2: February 8, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: I continued watching the Python tutorial. I also did a few Python exercises on Exercism, Edabit and HackerRank. I did this to find the platform I enjoy the most and therefore want to commit to. Edabit ended up being the platform that won me over.

**Thoughts**: I'm enjoying the python tutorial, it's very easy to understand. However, I did struggle with some of the exercises on HackerRank. HackerRank really had my brain scrambling. So I'm thinking of revisiting it when I gain a little more confidence with Python and I'll just focus on Edabit because it is more beginner friendly for me.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
