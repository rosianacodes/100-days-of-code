# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 7, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I watched a Python tutorial for beginners and coded along with it. 
I also watched 2 lessons of the ‘automate the boring stuff with python’ alongside the book format.

**Thoughts:** I’m really excited to use this knowledge in my daily life #softlife

### Day 2: February 8, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** I continued watching the Python tutorial. I also did a few Python exercises on Exercism, Edabit and HackerRank. I did this to find the platform I enjoy the most and therefore want to commit to. Edabit ended up being the platform that won me over.

**Thoughts:** I'm enjoying the python tutorial, it's very easy to understand. However, I did struggle with some of the exercises on HackerRank. HackerRank really had my brain scrambling. So I'm thinking of revisiting it when I gain a little more confidence with Python and I'll just focus on Edabit because it is more beginner friendly for me.

### Day 3: February 9, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** I've gone through a few lessons in the Automate the Boring Stuff with Python playlist, looked into Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code course and did a few Python exercises on edabit.

**Thoughts:** I'm really digging Angela's Yu's 100 days of code course. I'm considering starting it but after I finish watch the other youtube tutorials in my study plan. I found the python exercises on edabit really easy, which really boosted my confidence.

### Day 4: February 10, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** I learned about while loops, break statement and contiue statements. I also did a few python exercises.

**Thoughts:** I was really tired and found myself falling alseep through the python exercises but I'm proud of myself for sticking to this commitment no matter how tired I am.

### Day 5: February 11, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** I created a mad libs game in python with Mike Dane's Tutorial. Started watching the CS50 Python Lecture (the lecturer is really amazing, so engaging and easy to understand). I also did a few python exercises on HackerRank.

### Day 6: February 12, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** Today I worked on some of Day 1 of Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python Course covering printing, inputting, commenting, name error, syntax error, debugging and string manipulation.  

**Thoughts:** Even though I'm already familiar with all the topics covered. I really enjoyed how interactive it was, the debugging exercise was favourite.

### Day 7: February 13, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** Today I finished Day 1 of Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python Course, I created a mini band name generator project using input and print function, string manipulation, variables and next line.

### Day 8: February 14, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** I finished off the freecodecamp survey form using HTML, that I started a while ago. I'm glad I finally have that ticked off now

**Thoughts:** I decided to focus on HTML today as I feel like I hadn't touched it in a while and I'm glad I did because it was a great refresher for my mind. I prepared myself to start the 100devs bootcamp as I feel like I'm not confident in my front end skills, I'm starting to feel more confident in my back end skills because I'm spending more time on 'her'. So I think it's time I'm fair and treat back-end and front-end equally. Not sure how I'm going to do this maybe alternate between front end and python every other day or 2 days or weeks. I think I'm edging towards just doing what I feel like on the day.Shout out to my emotional authority.

### Day 9: February 16, 2023 

**Today's Progress:**  Today I worked on some of Day 2 of Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python Course covering data types and type conversions. 

**Thoughts:** I am so tired, kept falling asleep. So I kept my session very short. Hopefully tomorrow I'll have more energy.


### Day 10: February 17, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** Completed Day 2 of Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python Course. For today's project I made a tip calculator.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed creating this project, it's interesting to see how python is used to make our lives easier.


### Day 11: February 18, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** Worked on conditional statements with Day 3 of Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python Course.

**Thoughts:** I'm really falling in love with this course, even though some of the coding challenges take me a while to do. I feel like I'm really understanding the topics because I'm putting everything I learn into practice. I can't wait to see my progress over the next 100 days. I know it's going to be amazing. I really want to start watching the 100devs bootcamp because I don't feel as confident in my front end skills. My back-end skills are deffo taking the lead but I just think that may be becasue I've been spending more time doing it. I'm kinda considering software engineering now becasue I'm actually enjoying it but I want to give front end an equal chance before making up my mind or I can just be a full stack developer.
