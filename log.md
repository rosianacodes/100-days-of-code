# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 7, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I watched a Python tutorial for beginners and coded along with it. 
I also watched 2 lessons of the ‘automate the boring stuff with python’ alongside the book format.

**Thoughts:** I’m really excited to use this knowledge in my daily life #softlife

### Day 2: February 8, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: I continued watching the Python tutorial. I also did a few Python exercises on Exercism, Edabit and HackerRank. I did this to find the platform I enjoy the most and therefore want to commit to. Edabit ended up being the platform that won me over.

**Thoughts**: I'm enjoying the python tutorial, it's very easy to understand. However, I did struggle with some of the exercises on HackerRank. HackerRank really had my brain scrambling. So I'm thinking of revisiting it when I gain a little more confidence with Python and I'll just focus on Edabit because it is more beginner friendly for me.

### Day 3: February 9, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through a few lessons in the Automate the Boring Stuff with Python playlist, looked into Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code course and did a few Python exercises on edabit.

**Thoughts** I'm really digging Angela's Yu's 100 days of code course. I'm considering starting it but after I finish watch the other youtube tutorials in my study plan. I found the python exercises on edabit really easy, which really boosted my confidence.

### Day 4: February 10, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: I learned about while loops, break statement and contiue statements. I also did a few python exercises.

**Thoughts** I was really tired and found myself falling alseep through the python exercises but I'm proud of myself for sticking to this commitment to myself no matter how tired I am.
